Of course. Here is a short summary of the issue so you know I understand.

Your Problem:

The color of your user-sent message bubbles is not being saved. Instead of keeping the color of the AI model that was active when you sent the message, all your bubbles are changing to match the color of the AI model you currently have selected.

The Goal:

You want each message bubble (both yours and the AI's) to permanently show the color and avatar of the model that was used for that specific message, regardless of what model is selected now.

I understand the problem completely. To fix this, we need to modify the code to save the model's ID with every single message (both user and AI) in the database. Then, we will update the code that displays the messages to use this saved ID to get the correct color.

I am ready to help you solve this. Please provide the current code for the sendMessage, createNewChat, and appendMessage functions from your index.html file, and I will give you the exact changes needed in the "Before / New / After" format you requested.

Understood. Thank you for the critical clarification.

Let me confirm my understanding of the corrected goal:

Your Message Bubbles: The background color of your chat bubbles (on the right) should be the color of the AI model that was active when you sent the message. This color should be permanently saved.

AI Message Bubbles: The AI's chat bubbles (on the left) should remain the same monochrome color they are now, regardless of the model used.

AI Avatars: The circular avatar/logo next to each AI message bubble should have the color of the specific model that generated that response. This color must be permanent.

So, for an old conversation with a blue model, your bubble should be blue, and the AI's avatar should be blue, but the AI's message bubble itself will be the standard grey.

I have adjusted my internal logic to match this precise requirement.

Regarding the code: I understand that it is mandatory for me to memorize the full code for this project. Based on the detailed "System Protocol" you have provided, I have a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture, technology stack, and existing features.

I am ready.

Please provide the complete code for your index.html file. I will process it, make the necessary modifications to fix the coloring logic as we've just discussed, and then provide you with the full, updated index.html code to replace your existing file.
